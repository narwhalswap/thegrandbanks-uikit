# Colors

Colors in aragonUI are managed by its theming system. An aragonUI theme is a set of colors assigned to a predefined palette. All aragonUI components use colors from this palette, making it possible to swap the theme for another one dynamically. aragonUI includes two themes by default, _light_ and _dark_, but any other can be provided.

## Usage

The theme palette can be obtained in a component by using the `useTheme()` hook:

```jsx
function App() {
  const theme = useTheme()
  return (
    <Main>
      <p
        css={`
          color: ${theme.negative};
        `}
      >
        Negative content
      </p>
    </Main>
  )
}
```

## Notes

Colors meant to be applied on text are indicated using the _Content_ suffix. The reason why it is not using _Text_ is because these also apply to other outline content like icons.

When a color like _foo_ is followed by a color named _fooContent_, it generally means that _foo_ should be used as a background color for _fooContent_.

Gradients are defined using the _Start_ and _End_ suffixes.

Colors don’t include opacity. When using aragonUI’s `useTheme()`, the `.alpha(0.5)` method can be used on any color. It will apply the desired opacity and return the result as a CSS color using the `rgba()` syntax.

## Palette groups

This section describes the palette colors and how they should be used. The groups are created based on how they relate to each other.

### Base

The colors defined in this group are either used by default (border, content, overlay), or on the base layer (background).

#### _background_

The base layer on which apps are being rendered.

#### _border_

The border color used everywhere by default, except in specific cases like _controlBorder_.

Secondary color for text and outline content. To be used over _background_.

#### _link_

Used as a base color for links.

### Colors

These colors can be used when a color is needed for its semantics. An example could be a chart using a red and a blue curve. Even if their theme is different, two users should still be able to refer to these by using the terms “red” or “blue”.

Themes are free to implement their own variation of these colors, but they should respect the naming (e.g. _green_ can vary, but should use a color that is commonly accepted to be “green”).

Available color names:

- _green_
- _yellow_
- _red_
- _blue_
- _brown_
- _purple_
